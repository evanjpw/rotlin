## Acknowledgments

**rotlin** is modeled after, and heavily influenced by the rather excellent
 **[rot.js](https://github.com/ondras/rot.js)** \(_ROguelike Toolkit in JavaScript_\), by Ondřej Žára. Please see [http://ondras.github.com/rot.js](http://ondras.github.com/rot.js).

It was, in turn, inspired by [libtcod](http://roguecentral.org/doryen/libtcod/) \(_“The Doryen Library”_\).
